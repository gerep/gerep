### Oi ðŸ‘‹

I am writing software since 2012 and I think I am starting to understand it âš¡

Writing anything interesting that comes to mind on [my blog](https://gerep.github.io/).

Not a fan of the "how-to" wave we are currently in, how to get rich, how to get smart, how to get fit, etc.

I love everything slow.
