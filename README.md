### Oi ðŸ‘‹

I write software, and I try my best to do it right âš¡


I have interest in:
- philosophy
- decision making
- ego
- the purpose of family, life and work
- children education
- some books

I am writing anything interesting that comes to mind on [my blog](https://gerep.github.io/).

Not a fan of the "how-to" wave we are currently in, how to get rich, how to get smart, how to get fit, etc.

I love everything slow.
